**Location:** Tampere, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

## Project Description
The "Api Development Final Project" is a Node.js and Express-based API for managing a coffee shop's data, including information about coffees, customers, orders, and order details. It utilizes the Sequelize ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with an SQLite database. The API supports various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and error handling is implemented to ensure robustness.

### Features

#### Coffee Management:
- Create, read, update coffee information.
- Search for coffees by name or ID.

#### Customer Management:
- Create, read customer information.
- Search for customers by name.

#### Order Management:
- Create, read order information.
- Search for orders by date.

#### Order Detail Management:
- Create, read order detail information.
- Search for order details by coffee ID.

#### Error Handling:
- Demonstrates error handling for invalid input, non-existent resources, and other potential issues.
